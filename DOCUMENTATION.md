 **Firebase Firestore** is chosen as the database for this project.
 Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.

### Why Firestore?
- **Real-time updates**: Firestore provides real-time data synchronization, which is essential for a contact manager application where changes need to be reflected immediately.
- **Scalability**: Firestore can handle a large number of read and write operations, making it suitable for applications with a growing user base.
- **Easy integration**: Firestore integrates seamlessly with other Firebase services like Authentication, making it easier to manage user data and authentication.
- **Security**: Firestore offers robust security rules to protect data and ensure that only authorized users can access or modify the data.
- **Offline support**: Firestore supports offline data access, allowing users to interact with the application even when they are not connected to the internet.
